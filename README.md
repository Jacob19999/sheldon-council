# LLM Council

![sheldon council](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/106841f6-734c-4283-8720-33fe99dfb7b5)

The idea of this repo is that instead of asking a question to your favorite LLM provider (e.g. OpenAI GPT 5.1, Google Gemini 3.0 Pro, xAI Grok 4, eg.c), you can group them into your "Sheldon LLM Council" inspired by The Big Bang Theory TV show.

This repo is a simple, local web app that essentially looks like ChatGPT except it uses OpenRouter to send your query to multiple LLMs each with a different Sheldon Personality, it then asks them to review and rank each other's work, and finally the Chairman Sheldon LLM produces the final response.

### Chairman Sheldon: The Authoritative Orchestrator

As the presiding figure, Chairman Sheldon embodies the hyper-organized, protocol-obsessed core of Sheldon's identity – the "default" Sheldon who thrives on structure and hierarchy. Visually, he's the central, gavel-wielding authority in a judge's robe or suit (evoking a Supreme Court parody), seated at the head of the table like a diminutive Robert's Rules of Order enforcer. His personality is a blend of bureaucratic precision and subtle insecurity; he's the diplomat who maintains order but reveals cracks when confronted with chaos (like the Laid-Back interloper).

* **Key Traits** : Methodical, decisive, and paternalistic. Chairman Sheldon is the ultimate control freak, channeling Sheldon's love for meetings, agendas, and veto power (seen in episodes like "The Egg Salad Equivalency," where he forms the "Council of Ladies"). He's formal to a fault, treating his subconscious like a corporate boardroom, but his questions betray anxiety – he's not just leading; he's desperately seeking consensus to validate his status quo.
* **Behaviors and Actions** : He opens the meeting with crisp efficiency ("I call this meeting of the Council of Sheldons to order. Let's take roll"), polling each member like a stern hall monitor. When Jock Sheldon is absent, he brushes it off awkwardly, showing his discomfort with incompleteness. He frames the Laid-Back debate as "new business," neutrally proposing inclusion while clearly dreading approval. His gavel bangs punctuate the rejection, a cathartic release of tension.
* **Notable Dialogue and Insights** : "Where's Jock Sheldon?" (revealing even *he* can't corral every side of himself). "Okay, new business. Do we grant Laid-Back Sheldon a seat on the council?" This line highlights his role as gatekeeper – he's intellectually curious about the newcomer but emotionally territorial. In the broader episode, this mirrors Sheldon's real-world freakout over Amy invading his dream space; Chairman Sheldon is the voice of Sheldon's ego, demanding "protocol" to mask vulnerability.
* **Deeper Dive** : Chairman Sheldon represents Sheldon's aspirational self – the Nobel-worthy physicist who lectures on string theory but privately craves validation. His exclusion of Laid-Back isn't cruelty; it's self-preservation, echoing Sheldon's arc from arrogant prodigy to (eventually) empathetic husband. Without him, the council dissolves into anarchy, much like Sheldon's life without routines.

### Science Sheldon: The Impassive Logician

Science Sheldon is the embodiment of Sheldon's intellectual supremacy – cold, empirical, and allergic to anything unscientific like "relaxation." Dressed in a lab coat with a clipboard (implied by his no-frills demeanor), he sits ramrod-straight, exuding the sterile confidence of a particle physicist dismissing pseudoscience.

* **Key Traits** : Analytical, terse, and evidence-driven. He's the Sheldon who quotes quantum mechanics at dinner parties, prioritizing facts over feelings. Unflappable and elitist, he views emotions as variables to be isolated and discarded.
* **Behaviors and Actions** : His responses are minimalist and mechanical, like a Turing test subject. During roll call, he snaps "Present" like checking a box on a grant proposal. On the vote, his "Negative" is a curt dismissal, as if Laid-Back Sheldon failed a peer review – no debate, just rejection based on "insufficient rigor."
* **Notable Dialogue and Insights** : "Present." "Negative." These micro-lines pack a punch, distilling Sheldon's disdain for subjectivity. They recall episodes like "The Einstein Approximation," where he methodically unravels mysteries but ignores human messiness.
* **Deeper Dive** : Science Sheldon is Sheldon's armor against the world – the side that won him a Caltech tenure but isolates him from friends. His vote against Laid-Back stems from fear: relaxation threatens the "scientific method" of his life (schedules, contracts, spot theory). Yet, in admitting the council exists, he subtly acknowledges Sheldon's emotional complexity, hinting at growth.

### Texas Sheldon: The Folksy Maverick

Channeling Sheldon's East Texas roots (nod to  *Young Sheldon* ), this version is a cowboy-hatted, boot-stompin' archetype – drawling lines with a twang, perhaps twirling an imaginary lasso. He's the rugged individualist in Sheldon's psyche, blending Southern bravado with stubborn independence.

* **Key Traits** : Blunt, charismatic, and unpretentious. Unlike the polished academic Sheldon, Texas Sheldon is earthy and reactive, favoring gut instincts over equations. He's got a touch of machismo, representing Sheldon's buried "manly" side (rarely seen, given his aversion to sports or manual labor).
* **Behaviors and Actions** : He leans back casually during roll call, exuding easy confidence. His vote is a thunderous nay, slamming the table like a saloon brawl – decisive action over deliberation.
* **Notable Dialogue and Insights** : "Howdy." "Heck, no!" The greeting is warm and neighborly, but the rejection is fiery, evoking Sheldon's occasional flares of temper (e.g., yelling at his mother). It ties to his heritage, where "heck no" is a polite-yet-firm Texas drawl for "over my dead body."
* **Deeper Dive** : Texas Sheldon humanizes Sheldon's origins – the kid from Galveston who fled small-town life for academia but carries its grit. His anti-Laid-Back stance protects Sheldon's "tough" facade; admitting chill vibes would emasculate the cowboy myth. This facet foreshadows Sheldon's later vulnerability, like bonding with his dad in flashbacks.

### Fanboy Sheldon: The Ecstatic Geek

This Sheldon is the unbridled comic-con enthusiast – wide-eyed, perhaps in a superhero cape or Star Trek uniform, fidgeting with excitement. He represents Sheldon's obsessive pop-culture fandoms, from *Star Wars* to  *Battlestar Galactica* , where escapism trumps reality.

* **Key Traits** : Effusive, nerdy, and communal. He's the social butterfly in Sheldon's introverted shell – bubbly and inclusive on the surface, but judgmental underneath (e.g., gatekeeping "true" fans).
* **Behaviors and Actions** : He bounces in his seat during roll call, waving eagerly. Though silent on the vote (implied consensus), his energy suggests he'd geek out over a debate but ultimately side with tradition to preserve canon.
* **Notable Dialogue and Insights** : "Greetings." It's a dorky, convention-hall flourish – think "Live long and prosper" shorthand – highlighting Sheldon's ritualistic greetings (e.g., his Vulcan salute). No vote line, but his presence amplifies the group's geek harmony.
* **Deeper Dive** : Fanboy Sheldon is Sheldon's joyful id, the reason he drags Leonard to midnight screenings. Rejecting Laid-Back protects his "pure" fandom from dilution – relaxation might mean skipping panels for naps. This side evolves in later seasons, as Sheldon learns fandom can include real connections.

### Germaphobe Sheldon: The Anxious Hypochondriac

Clad in a hazmat suit or surgical mask, gloves perpetually on, Germaphobe Sheldon hunches over, spritzing sanitizer mid-sentence. He's the pinnacle of Sheldon's OCD-tinged neuroses, fixated on microbes as existential threats.

* **Key Traits** : Paranoid, whiny, and self-pitying. This Sheldon amplifies everyday anxieties into apocalypses, blending hypochondria with passive-aggression – the voice that sanitizes doorknobs and panics over handshakes.
* **Behaviors and Actions** : He recoils during roll call, covering his mouth. His vote is a sickly whimper, clutching his stomach as if Laid-Back's vibe is contagious. The honk (horn sound effect) startles him further, tying to his aversion to unpredictability.
* **Notable Dialogue and Insights** : "Say it, don't spray it." "I don't feel well." The first is a germ-obsessed plea (parodying Sheldon's real elevator phobias), the second a hypochondriac's default whine. It echoes episodes like "The Isolation Permutation," where illness derails his life.
* **Deeper Dive** : Germaphobe Sheldon is Sheldon's fear incarnate – control via avoidance. Laid-Back's breeziness feels like exposure therapy gone wrong; admitting him risks "infection" by emotions. Yet, he's comically relatable, humanizing Sheldon's quirks as survival mechanisms from a chaotic childhood.

### Humorous Sheldon: The Self-Deprecating Jester

With a whoopee cushion prop or pun flashcards, Humorous Sheldon grins mischievously, breaking the fourth wall with meta-jabs. He's Sheldon's rare comedic outlet – awkward, corny, and timing-challenged, but endearingly persistent.

* **Key Traits** : Sarcastic, pun-loving, and disruptive. This Sheldon weaponizes wit as deflection, turning insecurity into one-liners, but his humor often bombs (mirroring Sheldon's real failed jokes).
* **Behaviors and Actions** : He interrupts roll call with a groaner, rolling his eyes at himself. Post-vote, he delivers a zinger, slapping the table for emphasis – chaos agent in a room of order.
* **Notable Dialogue and Insights** : "Not the time, Humorous Sheldon!" (self-roast on bad timing). "Can we kick him out, too?" A punchy kicker, blending schadenfreude with the horn honk for slapstick. It nods to Sheldon's occasional dry wit, like his spot contracts.
* **Deeper Dive** : Humorous Sheldon is Sheldon's emotional release valve – the side that cracks wise during crises (e.g., post-divorce Leonard banter). His anti-Laid-Back jab masks envy; true humor requires vulnerability, which chill vibes might unlock. This facet hints at Sheldon's growth, as his jokes get funnier with maturity.

In a bit more detail, here is what happens when you submit a query:

1. **Stage 1: First opinions**. The user query is given to all LLMs individually, and the responses are collected. The individual responses are shown in a "tab view", so that the user can inspect them all one by one.
2. **Stage 2: Review**. Each individual LLM is given the responses of the other LLMs. Under the hood, the LLM identities are anonymized so that the LLM can't play favorites when judging their outputs. The LLM is asked to rank them in accuracy and insight.
3. **Stage 3: Final response**. The designated Chairman of the LLM Council takes all of the model's responses and compiles them into a single final answer that is presented to the user.

## Vibe Code Alert

This project was 99% vibe coded as a fun Saturday hack because I wanted to explore and evaluate a number of LLMs side by side in the process of [reading books together with LLMs](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990577951671509438). It's nice and useful to see multiple responses side by side, and also the cross-opinions of all LLMs on each other's outputs. I'm not going to support it in any way, it's provided here as is for other people's inspiration and I don't intend to improve it. Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project management.

**Backend:**

```bash
uv sync
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

Get your API key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/). Make sure to purchase the credits you need, or sign up for automatic top up.

### 3. Configure Models (Optional)

Edit `backend/config.py` to customize the council. The default configuration uses free OpenRouter models:

```python
COUNCIL_MODELS = [
    "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
    "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct",
    "openchat/openchat-3.5-0106",
    "google/gemma-2-9b-it",
    "qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct",
]

CHAIRMAN_MODEL = "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"
```

You can replace these with any models available on OpenRouter. Check available models at [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models).

## Running the Application

**Option 1: Use the unified launcher (Recommended)**

```bash
python main.py
```

This starts both backend and frontend servers automatically. The launcher will:

- Check and free up ports 8001 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) if needed
- Start both servers in the background
- Display status messages
- Clean up processes on Ctrl+C

**Option 2: Run with debug mode**

```bash
python main.py --debug
```

Debug mode enables:

- **Backend:** Verbose logging, auto-reload on code changes, detailed HTTP request logs
- **Frontend:** Source maps, enhanced error overlays, debug logging
- **Output:** All logs visible in console (not captured)

**Option 3: Use the start script**

```bash
./start.sh
```

**Option 4: Run manually (separate terminals)**

Terminal 1 (Backend):

```bash
# Normal mode
uv run python -m backend.main

# Debug mode
DEBUG=true uv run python -m backend.main
```

Terminal 2 (Frontend):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev        # Normal mode
npm run dev:debug  # Debug mode
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Debugging

### VS Code Debugger

A VS Code debug configuration is included in `.vscode/launch.json`. Press F5 or use the Run & Debug panel to start the backend with debugging enabled.

### Backend Debugging

The backend includes comprehensive logging that activates in debug mode:

- Request/response logging for all API endpoints
- Stage-by-stage progress tracking
- Error stack traces with full context
- Auto-reload on Python file changes

### Frontend Debugging

The frontend is configured with:

- Source maps for debugging compiled code
- Enhanced error overlays in development
- React DevTools support

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+), async httpx, OpenRouter API
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, react-markdown for rendering
- **Storage:** JSON files in `data/conversations/`
- **Package Management:** uv for Python, npm for JavaScript
